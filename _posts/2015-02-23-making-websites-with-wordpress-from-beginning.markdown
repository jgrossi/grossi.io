Hi!

Now I officially start my post series about how to use Wordpress to create websites. As I said on the [last blog post](http://grossi.io/2015/why-wordpress-is-your-best-option-for-creating-websites), if you want to develop a website faster and with awesome quality Wordpress is a very handful tool and unlike you think it can does much more what you even need.

## A real case

To illustrate how to create a website using Wordpress I'm going to use my own company's example: its [website](http://zero31.com.br). We had to develop a new website and the old one was developed using Zend Framework. As we've used Wordpress for some years that's the key to explain how you can use Wordpress in a real case to make websites faster and better.

### When to use Wordpress

You can be asking yourself when you should use Wordpress to make websites. The answer (for me) is simple: you should use Wordpress when you have to develop a dynamic website, with information changes, pictures uploads and updates. This website can has even a single page or even 50, 60, 70 pages. Off course, if you have a very big website you'll need some cache implemented but this is not a Wordpress problem. You have to use cache always you can to improve your website speed.

## Preparing the Theme

When we start to create a website we start with the design. Our designer draw what the website will have, make some wireframes and send it to the FrontEnd Engineer to start the front end part.

For didactic purposes we'll start with the frontend finished. We have already all CSS, JS, HTML and images files the website needs and we're going to start our development with Wordpress. Here you have a tip: `start using Wordpress when the layout and front end is ready to go`. Off course you will have to make some changes later, but the main structure is defined and you have everything you need to start. Now you can think what you will need from Wordpress to make the website!
