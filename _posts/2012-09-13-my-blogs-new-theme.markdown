  I am here to present my new blog theme. I know that I have to blog more but I am not having time for that. So, yesterday I was thinking in a way to blog more and decided to create a new blog theme. I think a clean and small blog theme can make me feel more productive and start to blogging more.

<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>I am here to present my new blog theme. I know that I have to blog more but I am not having time for that.</p>
<p>So, yesterday I was thinking in a way to blog more and decided to create a new blog theme. I think a clean and small blog theme can make me feel more productive and start to blogging more.</p>
<p>Even I install the incredible plugin <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-markdown/">WP-Markdown</a> that make me feel better and write more and faster.</p>
<p>Well, that's all. On this theme I used free icons my <a href="http://glyphicons.com/">Glyphicons</a>, <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> and Wordpress.</p>
<p>Enjoy and if want contact me at <a href="http://twitter.com/juniorgro">@juniorgro</a>!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
