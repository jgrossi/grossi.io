<p>Hello people!</p>
<p>I am now finishing my Post-graduate course in Web Development at PUCMG and I had the RubyOnRails discipline to do.</p>
<p>The final work was develop a simple Social Network app using RubyOnRails. I love that framework and think the Ruby language is amazing.</p>
<p>So, the final result is shared in GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/juniorgrossi/social_network_dsw7">https://github.com/juniorgrossi/social_network_dsw7</a> and the live app is hosted at my own domain: <a href="http://mysocial.juniorgrossi.com">http://mysocial.juniorgrossi.com</a>.</p>
<p>This app was decisive for my interest on improve my RoR knowledges. I am in love with the framework and some GEM's I use, like <a href="https://github.com/plataformatec/devise">Devise</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip">Paperclip</a>.</p>
<p>That's it! Thanks.</p>
